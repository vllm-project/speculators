## Overview

**Speculators** is a unified library for building, evaluating, and storing speculative decoding algorithms for large language model (LLM) inference, including in frameworks like vLLM. Speculative decoding is a lossless technique that speeds up LLM inference by using a smaller, faster draft model (i.e "the speculators") to propose tokens, which are then verified by the larger base model, reducing latency without compromising output quality. The speculator intelligently drafts multiple tokens ahead of time, and the base model verifies them in a single forward pass. This approach boosts performance without sacrificing output quality, as every accepted token is guaranteed to match what the main model would have generated on its own. Speculators standardizes this process with reusable formats and tools, enabling easier integration and deployment of speculative decoding in production-grade inference servers.

## Key Features

- **Unified Speculative Decoding Toolkit:** Simplifies the development, evaluation, and representation of speculative decoding algorithms, supporting both research and production use cases for LLMs.
- **Standardized, Extensible Format:** Provides a Hugging Face-compatible format for defining speculative models, with tools to convert from external research repositories into a standard speculators format for easy adoption.
- **Seamless vLLM Integration:** Built for direct deployment into vLLM, enabling low-latency, production-grade inference with minimal overhead.
- **Coming Soon:** The ability to train speculators directly through the speculators repository

## vLLM Inference

Once in the speculators format, you can serve the speculator using vLLM:

```bash
VLLM_USE_V1=1 vllm serve RedHatAI/Qwen3-8B-speculator.eagle3
```

Served models can then be benchmarked using [GuideLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/guidellm). Below, we show sample benchmark results where we compare our speculator with its dense counterpart. We also additionally compare [quantization](https://github.com/vllm-project/llm-compressor) to explore additional performance improvements by swapping the dense verifier, `Qwen/Qwen3-8B` with the quantized FP8 model, [RedHatAI/Qwen3-8B-FP8-dynamic](https://huggingface.co/RedHatAI/Qwen3-8B-FP8-dynamic) in the `speculator_config`.
