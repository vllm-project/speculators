General pydantic utilities for Speculators.

This module provides integration between Pydantic and the Speculators library,
enabling things like polymorphic serialization and deserialization of Pydantic
models using a discriminator field and registry.

class PydanticClassRegistryMixin(ReloadableBaseModel, ABC, ClassRegistryMixin):
    """
    A mixin class that integrates Pydantic models with the ClassRegistryMixin to enable
    polymorphic serialization and deserialization based on a discriminator field.

    This mixin allows Pydantic models to be registered in a registry and dynamically
    instantiated based on a discriminator field in the input data.
    It overrides Pydantic's validation system to correctly instantiate the appropriate
    subclass based on the discriminator value and the name of the registered classes.

    The mixin is particularly useful for implementing base registry classes that need to
    support multiple implementations, such as different token proposal methods or
    speculative decoding algorithms.

    Usage Example:
    ```python
    from typing import ClassVar
    from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
    from speculators.utils import PydanticClassRegistryMixin

    class BaseConfig(PydanticClassRegistryMixin):
        @classmethod
        def __pydantic_schema_base_type__(cls) -> type["BaseConfig"]:
            if cls.__name__ == "BaseConfig":
                return cls
            return BaseConfig

        schema_discriminator: ClassVar[str] = "config_type"
        config_type: str = Field(description="The type of configuration")

    @BaseConfig.register("config_a")
    class ConfigA(BaseConfig):
        config_type: str = "config_a"
        value_a: str = Field(description="A value specific to ConfigA")

    @BaseConfig.register("config_b")
    class ConfigB(BaseConfig):
        config_type: str = "config_b"
        value_b: int = Field(description="A value specific to ConfigB")

    BaseConfig.reload_schema()  # Ensures the schema is up-to-date with registry

    # Dynamic instantiation based on config_type
    config_data = {"config_type": "config_a", "value_a": "test"}
    config = BaseConfig.model_validate(config_data)  # Returns ConfigA instance
    print(config)
    dump_data = config.model_dump()  # Dumps the data to a dictionary
    print(dump_data)  # Output: {'config_type': 'config_a', 'value_a': 'test'}
