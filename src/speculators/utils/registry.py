"""
Registry system for classes in the Speculators library.

This module provides a flexible class registration and discovery system used
throughout the Speculators library. It enables automatic registration of classes
and discovery of implementations through class decorators and module imports.

The registry system is used to track different implementations of token proposal
methods, speculative decoding algorithms, and speculator models, allowing for
dynamic discovery and instantiation based on configuration parameters.

Classes:
    ClassRegistryMixin: Base mixin for creating class registries with decorators
        and optional auto-discovery capabilities through registry_auto_discovery flag.
    AutoClassRegistryMixin: A backward-compatible version of ClassRegistryMixin with
        auto-discovery enabled by default

class ClassRegistryMixin(AutoImporterMixin):
    """
    A mixin class that provides a registration system for tracking class
    implementations with optional auto-discovery capabilities.

    This mixin allows classes to maintain a registry of subclasses that can be
    dynamically discovered and instantiated. Classes that inherit from this mixin
    can use the @register decorator to add themselves to the registry.

    The registry is class-specific, meaning each class that inherits from this mixin
    will have its own separate registry of implementations.

    The mixin can also be configured to automatically discover and register classes
    from specified packages by setting registry_auto_discovery=True and defining
    an auto_package class variable to specify which package(s) should be automatically
    imported to discover implementations.

    Example:
    ```python
    class BaseAlgorithm(ClassRegistryMixin):
        pass

    @BaseAlgorithm.register()
    class ConcreteAlgorithm(BaseAlgorithm):
        pass

    @BaseAlgorithm.register("custom_name")
    class AnotherAlgorithm(BaseAlgorithm):
        pass

    # Get all registered algorithm implementations
    algorithms = BaseAlgorithm.registered_classes()
    ```

    Example with auto-discovery:
    ```python
    class TokenProposal(ClassRegistryMixin):
        registry_auto_discovery = True
        auto_package = "speculators.proposals"

    # This will automatically import all modules in the proposals package
    # and register any classes decorated with @TokenProposal.register()
    proposals = TokenProposal.registered_classes()
    ```

        registered to the extending subclass through the @subclass.register() decorator

        modules from the auto_package when set to True. Default is False.
    :cvar registry_populated: A flag that tracks whether the registry has been
