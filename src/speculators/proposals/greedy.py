"""
A module containing the implementation of the greedy based token proposal method,
where a single chain of tokens of length `speculative_tokens` is generated by the
speculator and verified by the verifier. This follows both the traditional
implementation of greedy as defined in the
[Spec-Bench paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07851) along with modifications to
support Spec-Verification as described in the
[SpecDec paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17192).
